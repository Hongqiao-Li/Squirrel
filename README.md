## Project Discrption
The purpose of the project is to help keep tracking of all the squirrels and start with the squirrel information information in Central Park. The project has now covered all the squirrels in Central Park and the user is later allowed to edit and add any squirrel information whenever any updating is required. Also, the location of squirrels is shown on the [OpenStreets map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about/). More guidance is given on the [Squirrel Tracker home page](www.google.com). Pre-existing squirrel data comes from [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) data.
